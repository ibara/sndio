sndio
=====
[Sndio](https://sndio.org/) is a small audio and MIDI framework part of
the [OpenBSD](https://www.openbsd.org/) project and ported to FreeBSD,
Linux and NetBSD. It provides a lightweight audio & MIDI server and a
fully documented user-space API to access either the server or the
hardware directly in a uniform way. Sndio is designed to work for
desktop applications, but pays special attention to synchronization
mechanisms and reliability required by music applications. Reliability
through simplicity are part of the project goals.

This package provides D bindings for version 1.7.0 of sndio.
